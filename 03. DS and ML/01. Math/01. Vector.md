### Vector Representation
Vectors are mathematical entities that have both magnitude and direction. In a coordinate system, a vector is often represented as an ordered list of components, corresponding to each dimension. For example, in 2D space, a vector can be written as \(\mathbf{v} = \langle v_x, v_y \rangle\), where \(v_x\) and \(v_y\) are the components along the x and y axes, respectively. In 3D space, it extends to \(\mathbf{v} = \langle v_x, v_y, v_z \rangle\).

Vectors can also be visualized graphically as arrows, where the length represents the magnitude, and the direction of the arrow indicates the vector's direction. Unit vectors (e.g., \(\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}\) in 3D) are used to denote direction in standard orthogonal directions with a magnitude of 1.

### Vector Addition and Subtraction
Vector addition combines two vectors to produce a third vector, calculated by adding corresponding components. If \(\mathbf{a} = \langle a_x, a_y \rangle\) and \(\mathbf{b} = \langle b_x, b_y \rangle\), then:
\[
\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \langle a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y \rangle
\]
Vector subtraction is similar but involves subtracting the corresponding components:
\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \langle a_x - b_x, a_y - b_y \rangle
\]
Graphically, vector addition can be visualized using the "head-to-tail" method, where the tail of the second vector is placed at the head of the first vector.

### Scalar Multiplication
Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes the vector's magnitude without affecting its direction (unless the scalar is negative, which reverses the direction). Given a vector \(\mathbf{v} = \langle v_x, v_y \rangle\) and a scalar \(c\), the scalar multiplication is:
\[
c \mathbf{v} = \langle c v_x, c v_y \rangle
\]
This operation is used to scale vectors up or down in size.

### Dot Product
The dot product (or scalar product) of two vectors results in a scalar quantity. It is given by:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_x b_x + a_y b_y + a_z b_z
\]
Alternatively, it can be expressed in terms of the vectors' magnitudes and the cosine of the angle \(\theta\) between them:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \cos \theta
\]
The dot product is useful for finding the angle between vectors and determining if they are orthogonal (perpendicular).

### Cross Product
The cross product (or vector product) of two vectors in 3D results in a new vector perpendicular to both original vectors. It is calculated as:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \langle a_y b_z - a_z b_y, a_z b_x - a_x b_z, a_x b_y - a_y b_x \rangle
\]
The magnitude of the cross product is:
\[
|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}| = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \sin \theta
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors. The cross product is commonly used in physics for torque and angular momentum calculations.

### Vector Magnitude
The magnitude (or length) of a vector \(\mathbf{v} = \langle v_x, v_y, v_z \rangle\) is calculated using the Euclidean norm:
\[
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}
\]
The magnitude represents the length of the vector in space.

### Vector Projection
The projection of vector \(\mathbf{a}\) onto vector \(\mathbf{b}\) gives a vector in the direction of \(\mathbf{b}\) with a length equal to the component of \(\mathbf{a}\) in that direction:
\[
\text{Proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{a} = \left( \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{|\mathbf{b}|^2} \right) \mathbf{b}
\]
This is useful in applications such as finding the component of a force in a given direction.

### Curl
The curl of a vector field measures the tendency of the field to rotate around a point. For a vector field \(\mathbf{F} = \langle F_x, F_y, F_z \rangle\), the curl is defined as:
\[
\text{curl} \, \mathbf{F} = \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} \right) \hat{i} + \left( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} \right) \hat{j} + \left( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right) \hat{k}
\]
The curl is used in vector calculus to describe the rotation of a field in fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and other areas.

### Gradient
The gradient of a scalar field is a vector field that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field and has a magnitude equal to the rate of change in that direction. For a scalar function \(f(x, y, z)\), the gradient is given by:
\[
\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right)
\]
The gradient is useful in optimization, machine learning (e.g., gradient descent), and physics for finding directions of maximum change in scalar fields.
